## Hello!

I am a Data Scientist with a strong focus on Computer Vision. My research explores Multi-Task Learning, Panoptic Segmentation, and AI applications in healthcare, aiming to develop cutting-edge solutions that enhance medical diagnostics.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Artificial Intelligence at THI (Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt), where I have worked on various research projects involving deep learning architectures, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP). My goal is to develop efficient AI models that can operate under real-world constraints.
